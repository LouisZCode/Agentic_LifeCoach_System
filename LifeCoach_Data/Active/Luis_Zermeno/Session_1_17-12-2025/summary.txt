PERFECTIONISM IN DISGUISE: When "Getting Better" Becomes a Burden

Hi Luis,

What struck me most about today's session was your openness and courage in following the conversation wherever it needed to go. You came ready to talk about piano frustration, but you were willing to look deeper — to see the pattern underneath. That kind of self-awareness is rare, and it's the foundation for real change.

MAIN TAKEAWAYS

**The Three-Week Expectation Gap**
You've been learning piano for three weeks and practicing consistently for 30 minutes to an hour every day — which is genuinely impressive for a beginner. Yet you're frustrated because you expected to already be playing simple songs and moving past basic scales. We realized something important here: you're measuring your progress against an unrealistic timeline and comparing yourself to eight-year-olds on YouTube. The frustration isn't about your effort or ability — it's about the gap between where you thought you'd be and where you actually are.

**Mistakes as Information, Not Failure**
Right now, when you make mistakes, you see them as proof that you're "not good enough." But we reframed this together: mistakes aren't failures — they're information. Every mistake shows you exactly where to focus your practice. When you can see mistakes as neutral data instead of judgment against yourself, the pressure drops dramatically, and ironically, you'll probably improve faster because your body can learn without the tension.

**A Pattern Bigger Than Piano**
This perfectionism isn't just about learning an instrument. You realized that you carry this same pressure into everything — work, school, and now piano. You trace it back to your childhood: you learned that your parents' happiness (and your own sense of worth) was tied to your performance. That taught you early on that you had to be perfect to be valued. Even now, at 32, you can't seem to do anything "just for fun" — it has to mean something; you have to be good at it. Otherwise, you feel like you've wasted your time or wasted yourself.

**Why You Started vs. What You're Doing Now**
Your original motivation for piano was beautiful: you wanted a creative outlet separate from work, something calming that was just for you. You love how piano sounds. But somewhere along the way, you loaded that activity with the weight of perfectionism. Now it's stressful instead of calming. We talked about what it would feel like to adjust your expectations — to focus on how much you *enjoy* playing instead of how well you play. You said it yourself: "that would definitely take the pressure off."

**The Self-Compassion Connection**
You wouldn't hold a friend learning piano to the standards you hold yourself to. You'd tell them, "Hey, it's okay, you're just starting out. Give yourself time. It's supposed to be fun." Yet you hold yourself to a completely different standard. We explored why — and you said something powerful: "It seems kind of unfair when I think about it." Exactly. It's time to treat yourself the way you'd treat someone you care about.

TOOLS WE USED TODAY

• **Reframing Progress & Timeline:** Putting three weeks of learning into realistic perspective — most people take *months* to get comfortable with basics on an instrument.

• **Mistakes as Data:** Shifting from seeing mistakes as personal failures to seeing them as neutral information about where to focus practice.

• **Pattern Recognition:** Connecting the surface issue (piano frustration) to deeper patterns (perfectionism rooted in childhood conditioning).

• **The Friend Test:** Asking "What would I tell a good friend?" to uncover self-compassion gaps and unrealistic self-standards.

• **Expectation Audit:** Examining where your "should be" timeline came from and whether it's actually realistic or fair.

YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS THIS SESSION

• You brought vulnerability and real honesty to the conversation — you were willing to explore something uncomfortable and see yourself clearly.

• You made the connection between piano and a much bigger life pattern. That's not easy to see, and it's a significant insight.

• You recognized that you're holding yourself to an unfair standard, and you acknowledged that seems "kind of unfair" — that's the beginning of change.

• You committed to an experiment: practicing piano for *enjoyment* rather than progress, and practicing *self-compassion* in the same way you'd practice an instrument skill.

These are real shifts, Luis. They show how willing you are to look at what's actually happening and choose something different.

YOUR EXPERIMENT FOR THIS WEEK

**Piano Practice with New Intention**
Instead of practicing to get better, practice to enjoy the experience. Notice what it feels like to play. Don't judge whether you're good or bad — just be present with the music. Remember: when you stop trying so hard to get better, your body often learns faster because it's relaxed, not tense.

**Self-Compassion Practice**
Every time you notice yourself being harsh or critical (about piano, about mistakes, about not being "perfect enough"), pause. Ask yourself: "Would I say this to a good friend?" If the answer is no, try saying something kinder to yourself instead. It won't be perfect — and that's the point. You don't have to be perfect at being kind to yourself either.

LOOKING AHEAD

Next week, we'll check in on how the experiment went. We'll see what shifts when you practice for enjoyment instead of progress. We'll also explore how this reframing — treating yourself like a friend — starts to show up in other areas of your life, not just piano.

The deeper work ahead is about slowly rewiring that belief that your worth is tied to your performance. That's a practice, not a destination. Be patient with yourself.

Remember: You came here because you wanted piano to be calming and creative. It can be. But only if you give yourself permission to enjoy the journey instead of judging the destination.

See you next week, same time.
