Fake Transcription - Maria & Luis - Testing Session

Maria [0:08]: hi luis
Maria [0:12]: can you hear me
Luis [0:15]: yeah i can hear you perfectly
Maria [0:18]: perfect how are you doing today
Luis [0:25]: i'm doing okay actually a bit stressed to be honest
Maria [0:32]: okay what's going on talk to me about it
Luis [0:45]: well so you know how i told you last time that i wanted to start learning piano
Maria [0:48]: yes i remember
Luis [0:55]: so i've been taking lessons for about three weeks now and i don't know i'm feeling really frustrated
Luis [1:05]: like i practice every day for at least thirty minutes sometimes an hour
Luis [1:12]: but i feel like i'm not making any progress at all
Maria [1:18]: okay so you're practicing consistently which is great
Maria [1:25]: but you're not seeing the progress you expected
Luis [1:28]: exactly
Luis [1:35]: and the thing is my teacher keeps telling me that i'm doing well for a beginner
Luis [1:42]: but when i listen to myself play it sounds terrible
Luis [1:48]: and then i go on youtube and i see these kids who are like eight years old playing chopin
Luis [1:55]: and i'm like what am i even doing
Maria [2:02]: i hear you
Maria [2:08]: it sounds like you're comparing yourself to others quite a bit
Luis [2:15]: yeah i guess i am
Luis [2:22]: i know i shouldn't but it's hard not to
Luis [2:30]: especially when you see all these videos of people who seem to just naturally get it
Maria [2:38]: okay let me ask you something
Maria [2:42]: when you decided to learn piano what was your motivation
Maria [2:48]: what made you want to start
Luis [2:58]: honestly i've always loved music
Luis [3:05]: and i wanted to have a creative outlet that wasn't related to work
Luis [3:12]: something that was just for me you know
Luis [3:18]: and i love how piano sounds i find it really calming
Maria [3:25]: that's beautiful
Maria [3:30]: so it was about having a creative outlet and finding something calming
Luis [3:35]: yeah exactly
Maria [3:42]: and when you're practicing now are you experiencing that calmness
Maria [3:48]: or is it more stressful
Luis [4:00]: well that's the thing
Luis [4:05]: at the beginning when i first sit down it feels good
Luis [4:12]: like i'm excited to practice
Luis [4:18]: but then after like ten or fifteen minutes i start getting frustrated
Luis [4:25]: because i keep making the same mistakes over and over
Luis [4:32]: and i feel like i should be past this by now
Maria [4:40]: okay so there's this expectation you have
Maria [4:45]: about where you should be at this point
Luis [4:50]: yeah i mean three weeks feels like a long time
Luis [4:58]: i thought i would at least be able to play a simple song by now
Luis [5:05]: but i'm still struggling with basic scales
Maria [5:15]: luis can i share something with you
Luis [5:18]: yeah of course
Maria [5:25]: three weeks is actually a very short time when it comes to learning an instrument
Maria [5:32]: like incredibly short
Maria [5:38]: most people take months just to get comfortable with the basics
Luis [5:45]: really
Maria [5:48]: yes really
Maria [5:55]: and the fact that you're already practicing consistently every day
Maria [6:02]: that's actually quite impressive for someone just starting out
Luis [6:10]: i guess i never thought about it that way
Luis [6:18]: i just feel like i should be better by now
Maria [6:25]: where do you think that feeling comes from
Maria [6:30]: that you should be better
Luis [6:40]: i don't know
Luis [6:48]: maybe because i'm used to picking things up quickly
Luis [6:55]: like at work when i learn new software or new processes
Luis [7:02]: it usually clicks pretty fast for me
Luis [7:08]: so i guess i expected piano to be similar
Maria [7:18]: that makes sense
Maria [7:25]: but learning a musical instrument is different from learning software
Maria [7:32]: it involves muscle memory physical coordination
Maria [7:38]: it's not just intellectual understanding
Luis [7:45]: yeah you're right
Luis [7:52]: i never really thought about the physical aspect of it
Maria [8:00]: exactly and your body needs time to develop that muscle memory
Maria [8:08]: it's not something you can rush
Maria [8:15]: even if your brain understands what you need to do
Maria [8:22]: your fingers need time to learn how to do it
Luis [8:30]: that actually makes me feel a bit better
Luis [8:38]: because i was starting to think maybe i'm just not musical
Luis [8:45]: or maybe i'm too old to learn
Maria [8:52]: too old
Maria [8:55]: how old are you again
Luis [8:58]: thirty two
Maria [9:02]: thirty two is definitely not too old to learn piano
Maria [9:08]: people start learning instruments in their sixties and seventies
Luis [9:15]: really
Maria [9:18]: yes absolutely
Maria [9:25]: age is not the barrier you think it is
Maria [9:32]: the only real barrier is giving up
Luis [9:40]: okay that's good to know
Luis [9:48]: but what about the frustration
Luis [9:55]: like how do i deal with that
Luis [10:02]: because it's starting to make me not want to practice
Maria [10:12]: okay so let's talk about that
Maria [10:18]: the frustration is telling you something
Maria [10:25]: what do you think it's trying to tell you
Luis [10:35]: i don't know
Luis [10:42]: that i'm not good enough maybe
Maria [10:48]: or maybe
Maria [10:55]: that you're putting too much pressure on yourself
Luis [11:05]: yeah maybe
Luis [11:12]: i do tend to be pretty hard on myself
Maria [11:20]: and what would happen if you weren't
Maria [11:28]: what would happen if you just enjoyed the process
Maria [11:35]: without worrying about how good you are
Luis [11:45]: i guess it would be more fun
Luis [11:52]: and less stressful
Maria [12:00]: exactly
Maria [12:05]: remember why you started
Maria [12:12]: you wanted a creative outlet something calming
Maria [12:20]: you didn't start because you wanted to become a concert pianist
Luis [12:28]: no definitely not
Luis [12:35]: i just wanted to play for myself
Maria [12:42]: so what if you adjusted your expectations
Maria [12:50]: what if instead of focusing on how well you play
Maria [12:58]: you focused on how much you enjoy playing
Luis [13:08]: that's a different way to think about it
Luis [13:15]: i like that
Luis [13:22]: but it's hard to not focus on the mistakes
Maria [13:30]: of course it is
Maria [13:35]: mistakes are part of learning
Maria [13:42]: they're not failures they're information
Luis [13:50]: information about what
Maria [13:58]: about what you need to practice more
Maria [14:05]: every mistake shows you where to focus your attention
Maria [14:12]: it's actually a good thing
Luis [14:20]: i never thought about mistakes that way
Luis [14:28]: i always just saw them as proof that i'm not good enough
Maria [14:38]: and that's a really common way to see mistakes
Maria [14:45]: but it's not the only way
Maria [14:52]: what if mistakes were just neutral information
Maria [15:00]: not good not bad just data
Luis [15:10]: that would definitely take the pressure off
Luis [15:18]: i think i could handle mistakes better if i saw them that way
Maria [15:28]: so let's try an experiment
Maria [15:35]: for the next week i want you to practice
Maria [15:42]: but with a different intention
Luis [15:48]: okay what kind of intention
Maria [15:58]: instead of practicing to get better
Maria [16:05]: practice to enjoy the experience
Maria [16:12]: just notice what it feels like to play
Maria [16:20]: don't judge whether you're good or bad
Maria [16:28]: just be present with the music
Luis [16:38]: that sounds nice actually
Luis [16:45]: but also a little scary
Maria [16:52]: why scary
Luis [17:00]: because if i'm not trying to get better
Luis [17:08]: what's the point
Maria [17:18]: the point is to enjoy it
Maria [17:25]: the point is to have that creative outlet you wanted
Maria [17:32]: and here's the interesting thing
Maria [17:40]: when you stop trying so hard to get better
Maria [17:48]: you often actually improve faster
Luis [17:58]: really how does that work
Maria [18:08]: because you're relaxed
Maria [18:15]: when you're not tense and stressed about mistakes
Maria [18:22]: your body can learn more naturally
Maria [18:30]: it's like trying to force yourself to fall asleep
Maria [18:38]: the harder you try the harder it becomes
Luis [18:48]: oh wow that makes sense
Luis [18:55]: i never connected those two things
Maria [19:05]: so are you willing to try this experiment
Maria [19:12]: just for one week
Luis [19:20]: yeah i'll try it
Luis [19:28]: i mean what do i have to lose right
Maria [19:35]: exactly
Maria [19:42]: and let's check in next week
Maria [19:48]: see how it goes
Luis [19:55]: okay sounds good
Luis [20:05]: i'm actually feeling a bit better about this now
Luis [20:12]: like less pressure
Maria [20:20]: good that's the goal
Maria [20:28]: remember learning should be enjoyable
Maria [20:35]: especially when you're doing it for yourself
Luis [20:45]: yeah you're right
Luis [20:52]: i think i just needed someone to remind me of that
Maria [21:02]: we all need reminders sometimes
Maria [21:10]: is there anything else on your mind today
Luis [21:20]: actually yeah there is one more thing
Luis [21:28]: it's kind of related
Maria [21:35]: okay go ahead
Luis [21:45]: so i've been thinking about why i'm so hard on myself
Luis [21:52]: and i realized it's not just with piano
Luis [22:00]: it's with everything
Luis [22:08]: like at work too
Luis [22:15]: i always feel like i need to be perfect
Maria [22:25]: okay so this is a pattern you're noticing
Luis [22:32]: yeah exactly
Luis [22:40]: and i'm wondering where it comes from
Luis [22:48]: like why am i like this
Maria [22:58]: that's a good question
Maria [23:05]: when did you first notice this pattern
Luis [23:18]: i don't know maybe when i was in school
Luis [23:25]: i was always trying to get the best grades
Luis [23:32]: and my parents were really happy when i did well
Maria [23:42]: and what happened when you didn't do well
Luis [23:52]: i mean they didn't get angry or anything
Luis [24:00]: but i could tell they were disappointed
Luis [24:08]: and i hated that feeling
Luis [24:15]: so i just worked harder to make sure i always did well
Maria [24:25]: so you learned that your worth was tied to your performance
Luis [24:35]: yeah i guess so
Luis [24:42]: i never really thought about it that way before
Luis [24:50]: but that makes sense
Maria [25:00]: and now even when you're doing something just for fun
Maria [25:08]: like learning piano
Maria [25:15]: you still have that same pressure
Luis [25:25]: exactly
Luis [25:32]: it's like i can't just do something for enjoyment
Luis [25:40]: it has to mean something
Luis [25:48]: i have to be good at it
Maria [25:58]: and what would it mean if you weren't good at it
Luis [26:10]: i don't know
Luis [26:18]: i guess that i'm not good enough
Luis [26:25]: or that i wasted my time
Maria [26:35]: okay so there's a lot tied up in this
Maria [26:42]: your sense of self worth
Maria [26:50]: your fear of wasting time
Maria [26:58]: your need to prove yourself
Luis [27:08]: yeah when you put it like that it sounds really heavy
Maria [27:18]: it is heavy
Maria [27:25]: and that's probably why piano feels so stressful
Maria [27:32]: because you've loaded it with all of this meaning
Luis [27:42]: so what do i do about it
Maria [27:52]: well first just recognizing it is important
Maria [28:00]: you can't change something you're not aware of
Luis [28:08]: okay so i'm aware now
Luis [28:15]: what's next
Maria [28:25]: next is practicing self compassion
Maria [28:32]: which i know sounds cheesy
Maria [28:40]: but it's actually really powerful
Luis [28:48]: self compassion
Luis [28:55]: what does that mean exactly
Maria [29:05]: it means treating yourself the way you would treat a good friend
Maria [29:12]: if your friend was learning piano and struggling
Maria [29:20]: what would you say to them
Luis [29:32]: i would probably say something like
Luis [29:40]: hey it's okay you're just starting out
Luis [29:48]: give yourself time
Luis [29:55]: it's supposed to be fun
Maria [30:05]: exactly
Maria [30:12]: so why not say those things to yourself
Luis [30:22]: because i don't know
Luis [30:30]: it feels different when it's me
Maria [30:38]: why does it feel different
Luis [30:48]: because i should know better
Luis [30:55]: i should be able to handle this
Maria [31:05]: according to who
Luis [31:15]: i don't know
Luis [31:22]: according to me i guess
Maria [31:32]: so you're holding yourself to a standard
Maria [31:40]: that you wouldn't hold anyone else to
Luis [31:50]: yeah that's exactly what i'm doing
Luis [31:58]: that seems kind of unfair when i think about it
Maria [32:08]: it is unfair
Maria [32:15]: to yourself
Luis [32:25]: so i need to be more fair to myself
Luis [32:32]: treat myself like i would treat a friend
Maria [32:42]: yes exactly
Maria [32:50]: and that includes when you make mistakes
Maria [32:58]: when you're learning something new
Maria [33:05]: when you're not perfect
Luis [33:15]: this is going to be hard
Luis [33:22]: i've been doing the opposite for so long
Maria [33:32]: it will take practice
Maria [33:40]: just like learning piano
Maria [33:48]: but every time you notice yourself being harsh
Maria [33:55]: you can pause and choose differently
Luis [34:05]: okay i can try that
Luis [34:12]: both with piano and with other things
Maria [34:22]: that's all anyone can do
Maria [34:30]: just try
Luis [34:40]: you know this conversation has been really helpful
Luis [34:48]: i came in just wanting to vent about piano
Luis [34:55]: but we ended up talking about something much bigger
Maria [35:05]: that happens sometimes
Maria [35:12]: the surface issue is connected to deeper patterns
Luis [35:22]: yeah i can see that now
Luis [35:30]: thank you for helping me see it
Maria [35:38]: you're welcome
Maria [35:45]: you did the work by being open to looking at it
Luis [35:55]: so for next week
Luis [36:02]: i'm going to practice piano for enjoyment
Luis [36:10]: and i'm going to practice being kinder to myself
Maria [36:20]: that sounds like a great plan
Maria [36:28]: and remember it's practice
Maria [36:35]: you don't have to be perfect at being kind to yourself either
Luis [36:45]: ha that's a good point
Luis [36:52]: i would probably put pressure on myself to do that perfectly too
Maria [37:02]: exactly so just notice when you do that
Maria [37:10]: and have a sense of humor about it
Luis [37:20]: okay i will
Luis [37:28]: thank you maria this really helped
Maria [37:35]: i'm glad
Maria [37:42]: let's talk next week same time
Luis [37:48]: perfect see you then
Maria [37:52]: take care luis
Luis [37:55]: you too bye
Maria [37:58]: bye
